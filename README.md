### LSTM In C++ Code 
1. realize the training procedure: BPTT in C++ 
2. ToDo list


### LSTM In Pyhton    
- Dataset from : [New York Stock Exchange S&P 500 companies historical prices with fundamental data](https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse)
![compared with MA](http://github.com//YangQingQingKerry//lstm_cpp//raw//master//image//lstm.png)


 


### Inspiration

Here is couple of things one could try out with this data:

- One day ahead prediction: Rolling Linear Regression, ARIMA, Neural Networks, LSTM
- Momentum/Mean-Reversion Strategies
- Security clustering, portfolio construction/hedging

Which company has biggest chance of being bankrupt? Which one is undervalued (how prices behaved afterwards), what is Return on Investment?
